# Create Pipes to Improve Budget and Duration Formatting

# Challenge Description
In this challenge, we want to display movie budgets as follows using a custom pipe:
- If the budget is "175", render it as "$175 million"
- If the budget is a range such as "175-200", render it as "$175 to $200 million"
- Then create another custom pipe to format the movie duration so that "92" is displayed as "1h 32min"

## Requirements
- Edit the provided `src/pipes/million-dollar.pipe.ts`
- Implement the transform method to format input values as defined in the challenge description:
   - If the budget is "175", render it as "$175 million"
   - If the budget is a range such as "175-200", render it as "$175 to $200 million"
> ðŸ’¡ HINT: Not sure how to parse strings in Javascript? Take a look at [string.split()](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/String/split)
- Add your pipe to the template of `movie-item.component.ts` and ensure the movie budgets are displayed as required
- Edit the provided `src/pipes/min-to-duration.pipe.ts`
- Implement the transform method to format input values as defined in the challenge description:
   - "92" must be displayed as "1h 32min"
- Add your pipe to the template of `movie-item.component.ts` and ensure the movie durations are displayed as required
> ðŸ’¡ HINT: This challenge can make use of a lot of modern Javascript features covered in the Javascript section of our training (template strings, ?? operator, and more)

## Other Considerations

- If you see the `data-test` attribute anywhere in the boilerplate don't remove it.

## Example of Finished Application

This is an example of what the functionality should look like for the completed exercise. If youâ€™d like to mimic this style, feel free to do so, but it is not required.
